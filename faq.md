Who are you?
------------

I am a Software Engineer and amateur web developer and game programmer. I'm very opinionated and passionate about topics like Software, Hardware, News, Philosophy, and Politics.

Why are you doing this?
-----------------------

Because posting Facebook ranting is never a good way to really express oneself, and internet message boards are messy. This way I can control the content and know that it won't be censured by anyone except me and any NSA hacking operations.

What do you do for a living?
----------------------------

I'm a Software Engineer in Portland, OR and I work on CAD programs. 

What do you do for fun?
-----------------------

Now THAT'S the kind of question I like. I'm an avid follower of games, player of games, and hobbyist game developer, both video and tabletop. I enjoy writing both software and prose, but I'm only good at the former. I very much enjoy critiquing cinema and television. I'm passionate about effecting civic changes to benefit people. I'm also a keen follower of the growing Virtual Reality movement.   

What is your favorite color?
----------------------------

Blue! No wait, Yello- *is cast off the bridge*

But seriously. Dark Green for the win. 

Do you read webcomics?
----------------------

[Do I](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/)? [Hah](http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/)! [Why would anyone read webcomics](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots.html)? [That's completely mental](http://xkcd.com/)! [Seriously](http://abstrusegoose.com/)
